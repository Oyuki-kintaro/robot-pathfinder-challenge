# Robot Pathfinder Challenge

Welcome to the Robot Pathfinder Challenge! This assignment is designed to assess your problem-solving skills and ability to implement a path planning algorithm for a robot in a 2D grid environment.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Implement your solution in the `robot.py` file.
4. Push your changes to your forked repository.
5. Submit the link to your forked repository.

**Deadline**: Please complete and submit your solution within 48 hours of receiving this assignment.

## Assignment Details

Your task is to implement a path planning algorithm for a robot navigating a 2D grid environment. The main requirements are as follows:

1. Implement a function `plan_path(start, goal, map_file)` in `robot.py` that:
   - Reads the map from `map.txt`
   - Finds a path from `start` to `goal` avoiding obstacles
   - Returns the path as a list of (x, y) coordinates

2. Choose and implement one of the following algorithms:
   - Breadth-First Search
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm
   - A* Search

3. Include comments in your code explaining your algorithm choice and implementation details.

4. Write at least two unit tests demonstrating your solution's correctness.

## File Descriptions

- `robot.py`: This is where you should implement your solution.
- `map.txt`: This file contains the 2D grid representation (0 for free space, 1 for obstacles).

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on:
- Correctness of the implementation
- Code quality and organization
- Efficiency of the chosen algorithm
- Quality of comments and explanation
- Thoroughness of unit tests

## Submission

Once you've completed the assignment, please email the link to your forked repository to lydia@astroportspace.com.

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your solution!
